<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">This project showcases how advanced analytics and predictive modeling were applied to aviation crash data to transform safety protocols. By analyzing historical flight data, key factors such as flight phase and crash causes were identified, enabling accurate prediction of crash probabilities. This data-driven approach helps aviation authorities and airlines address high-risk scenarios and enhance overall safety and risk management strategies.</span></p><p><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1556/2/1.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><br></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Background</span><o:p></o:p></span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal">

</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%">The aviation
industry faces safety challenges, with technical failures responsible for
around 25% of accidents globally. As aircraft complexity and traffic volume
grow, there is a heightened need for advanced safety measures. This project
uses predictive analytics, real-time monitoring, and data-driven insights to
identify and mitigate potential technical failures, enhancing overall safety
standards.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1556/2/2.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><b><br></b></p><p><b>Problem Statement</b><font color="#2b373e" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size: 18px; font-family: Arial;"><br></span></font></p><p class="MsoNormal">Aviation safety remains a critical concern despite
advancements in technology and safety protocols.&nbsp;<span style="color:red">60-70%&nbsp;</span>of
all aviation accidents are caused by human error, making it the leading factor
contributing to crashes. This includes errors in pilot judgment, communication
failures, and procedural mistakes during key flight phases like takeoff and
landing. Additionally,&nbsp;<span style="color:red">17-20%&nbsp;</span>of
aircraft accidents are attributed to mechanical or technical failures,
resulting from inadequate maintenance, unforeseen technical faults, or system
malfunctions.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1556/2/3.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b><br></b></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>Objective</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p><span style="font-family: Arial;">To enhance aviation safety by reducing crashes caused by technical failures and human error by implementing predictive maintenance systems and enhancing pilot training programs, which will help minimize crash risks, reduce costs, and deliver a high return on investment (ROI).</span></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1556/2/4.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><o:p><br></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p><br></o:p></p>
